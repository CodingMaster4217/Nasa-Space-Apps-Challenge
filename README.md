Nasa Space Apps Challenge - Meteor Madness

I created an interactive tool in Python that uses real data from NASAâ€™s Near Earth Object database to model asteroid impact scenarios. The program shows asteroids in a scatter plot and lets users explore their size, speed, and distance from Earth. It calculates possible impact effects and compares three prevention methods: kinetic impactor, gravity tractor, and nuclear detonation. This project is important because it demonstrates how open data and technology can be used to understand global risks and how different strategies might reduce the damage.
